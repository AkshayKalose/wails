# Bindings Generator Guide

Welcome to the Wails v3 Bindings Generator Guide!

One of the key features of Wails is the ability to seamlessly integrate backend Go code with the frontend, enabling
efficient communication between the two layers. This can be done manually by sending messages between the frontend and
backend, but this can be cumbersome and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex data types.

The bindings generator in Wails v3 simplifies this process by automatically generating JavaScript or TypeScript
functions and models that reflect the methods and data structures defined in your Go code. This means you can write
your backend logic in Go and easily expose it to the frontend without the need for manual binding or complex integration.

This guide is designed to help you understand and utilise this powerful binding tool.
